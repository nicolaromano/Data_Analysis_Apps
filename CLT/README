This app can be used to demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem, through a simulation-based approach.

The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal (Gaussian) distribution, regardless of the shape of the original distribution.

In the app, it is possible to choose:

- The distribution of the random variables (normal, uniform, exponential, bimodal or gamma)
- The sample size for each sample
- The number of samples to be generated

When one of the parameters is changed, the app generates a new set of samples and plots the histogram of the sample means as well as the population distribution.
Students can use the app to explore the Central Limit Theorem and understand how the sample size and the number of samples affect the convergence to the normal distribution.

This can be easily run in class when explaining the CLT; further exploration can be done by students, for example, by comparing the convergence to the normal distribution for different sample sizes or distributions.
